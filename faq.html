    <button class="slide-down-btn">What is 4-H?</button>
    <p class="slide-down">4-H is a worldwide youth development program
        available in every state and over eighty countries. It is open
        to all youth aged 5 to 19, who want to have fun, learn new skills,
        and explore the world.  In return, youth who participate in 4-H
        find a supportive environment and opportunities for hands-on or
        "experiential" learning about things that interest them.  They
        also get what all young people need to succeed in life - the
        confidence, compassion and connections with caring adults to
        make contributions to their communities.  The mission of Cornell
        Cooperative Extension 4-H Youth Development is to unleash the
        power of youth and adults through diverse opportunities that
        meet community needs.</p>

    <button class="slide-down-btn">How do the Botany Besties follow 4-H standards?</button>
    <p class="slide-down">The Botany Besties are a group of kids ages
        8 to 18 that want to learn more in depth about Plant Sciences,
        do experiments, and, following the mission of 4-H, learn
        hands-on through activities and field trips.  The Botany Besties
        also work on community service projects, such as our 
        <a href="gardens.html">Food Donation Project</a>.  As we learn,
        we hope to make friends, develop life skills, and contribute
        to our community.  If you would like to join us, fill out our
        <a href="join.html">Join form</a>.  We hope to see you at our
        next meeting!</p>

    <button class="slide-down-btn">What is 4-H Appropriate?</button>
    <p class="slide-down">4-H Appropriate, sometimes abbreviated as
        4-H A, is what is deemed appropriate in the 4-H setting.
        This generally includes respect, good sportsmanship, supportive
        actions to one another, and other positive actions.  In 4-H, we
        discourage swearing, immodest dress, and other activities deemed
        inappropriate.  If you have any questions, please fill out the
        <a href="contact.html">Contact form</a> and one of our co-leaders
        will follow up.</p>

    <button class="slide-down-btn">What other opportunities are available?</button>
    <p class="slide-down">4-H has many clubs for different areas of interest,
        such as Animal Science clubs, Art clubs, and Cooking clubs.  To see
        the full list, you can go to the <a href="http://ccetompkins.org/4-h-youth/4-h-clubs">CCE Tompkins
