        <warmup>For our warmup this month, we unscrambled veggies with our bodies.
        We were suprised at everyone's creativity!  One person used sign language,
        another kid held up a pillow to make an I, and two stood hanging a kid
        between them to make an H...  We had a lot of fun!</warmup>

        This month, we learned about growing salad indoors and the different
        beneficial or pest insects.</summary>
        <s>In the Growing Salad Indoors portion of the
        meeting, we learned some general info on various recycled containers, layering
        to improve nutrition, how to prevent bolting and make your lettuce last longer
        and be more productive even in the heat,... And encourage kids to try their own!
        </s>
        <s>
        For the beneficial or pest insect portion of the meeting, we learned about
        some insects in our yard.  For each insect, we learned why they were consedered
        beneficial or a pest, and what we could do to promote or control them.
        For more information, the slideshows can be seen in the Resources page.</s>
        <community-service>We were each encouraged to talk about someone we knew who
        was a front-line worker, and afterwards we drew cards to mail to a hospital
        thanking our essential workers.</community-service>

        <warmup>For the warmup this meeting, we warmed up with a few fun riddles to
        get our brains moving.  Everyone was very creative!  Great job!
        If you would like to see the answers, take a peek at the bottom of this warmup.
        Some of the riddles we used include:</warmup>
        <riddles>
            <r>Which is heavier:  A pound of feathers or a pound of lead?</r>
            <r>Which is faster:  Heat or cold?</r>
            <r>Which American had the biggest family?</r>
        </riddles>
        
        <scavenger-hunt>
        In designing this scavenger hunt, we had to think about ways to allow our members
        to express themselves, be creative and have some fun.  Solving riddles inspires
        us to look at things differently.  It helps us to come up with creative solutions
        and encourage us to 'think outside the box'.  To solve these riddles, we had to
        use our ingenuity and creativity, think critically, and ask ourselves questions
        to discover new solutions.  Everyone brought back some very creative objects for
        the riddles we used!  Here's our scavenger hunt:</scavenger-hunt>

        <s>Something you toss</s>
        <s>Something that changes shape</s>
        <s>Something that smells fantastic</s>
        <s>Something that changes color</s>
        <s>Something you freeze</s>
        <s>Something that grows</s>
        <s>Something shiny</s>
        <s>Something a plant needs</s>
        <s>Something hairy</s>
        <s>Though the stores are closed,
        to only those fearless,
        what can we do,
        to make us not mealless?</s>

        <summary>This meeting, we had a 4-H Fair update about the scheduled virtual events
        we could participate in, took a look at the data we collected on our favorite insect,
        had a Weed Challenge.  We all did very well!  Good job, everyone!  And finally, we
        had grafted ginkgos during a previous meeting and some were successful!</summary>
        <community-service>For this meeting's community service section, we gave updates on

        <warmup>For the warmup this meeting, each member finds two objects.  Some of
        these objects included squash, bracelets, a small bottle, and a matrioshki doll
        (Russian nesting doll).  Then, each member takes turns telling
        a few sentences of a story, including both of their objects.  The next
        person then adds to the story with a few more sentences including
        their objects and repeat until everyone has had a turn.  We then read the completed
        story out loud.  We created a story about a bracelet with a secret on how to make a
        potion that made the meany zucchini nice again.  Everyone was very creative!</warmup>
        <summary>This meeting, we had a fun time learning about mimicry and look-a-likes.  We
        learned about identifying characteristics of a plant for identification and learned
        about convergent evolution and evolutionary mimicry.  Then, we did a fun Kahoot to
        review our second weed list and watched the "Vegetable Orchestra" play.</summary>
        <community-service>For this meeting's community service section, we gave updates on

        <year>2020</year>
        <warmup>We picked veggies from our garden and made art with them.  One member did
        a person, another did a butterfly, and someone even did a Mr. Potatohead!  Afterwards, we
        gave some ideas on how to reuse our veggies after we finished our veggie art.  Two
        members put theirs on a pizza, some just ate them raw (that took care of most of
        the veggies!), and others gave them to their chickens.  Don't worry, we didn't cook
        Mr. Potatohead.  He's reusable veggie art!  Great job, Botany Besties!
        For more examples, see the warmup on the Resources page and take a look at the slideshow
        we used during the meeting.</warmup>
        <summary>This meeting, we learned about and did a chromatography experiment about Hidden
        Colors on leaves we found around our yard.  Everyone's chromatography turned out wonderful!
        And everyone did amazing on the discussion questions afterwards!  We also did a fun weed
        Kahoot using all of the weeds we've learned so far.  Everyone did great!</summary>
        <community-service>For this meeting's community service section, we updated on
        dropping food off for the food pantry and at local Neighborhood Food Hubs to support our
        community.  Everyone's gardens are doing great!  Keep up the awesome work, Botany

        <year>2020</year>
        <summary>We had a guest speaker present "Plant Breeding 101: How and why humans
        make better crop plants".  We learned why plant breeding is important, how
        it works, and how it impacts all parts of our lives.  We learned the basics of
        artificial selection, a bit of history of crop plants, and had a few interactive
        activities to give us an idea of what plant breeders do and think about.  We were
        so glad to have them present at our meeting!</summary>

        <warmup>For this meeting's warmup, we had fun with a game similar to Taboo where
        we guessed the different things that could pollinate a plant with the given clues. 
        We learned that there are many more pollinators than just bees.  Feel free to check
        out the slideshow in the warmups in the Resources page!</warmup>
        <summary>This meeting, we had learned about composting with a few guest speakers
        from Cornell.  We learned about what we can compost, how to compost, and a few helper
        critters that help break down our compost into something we can use in out gardens. 
        Also, one of the club members did a fantastic presentation of their favorite Top 5
        Trees!  They taught us about the trees' identifying features, ranges where they grow,
        and their uses.  Their presentation is available in the Topics section on the Resources page.
        For this meeting's science experiment, we learned about the Mysteries of Color.
        We learned how we see colors, how plants see colors, and what we can do to help
        plants grow, using what we learned.  We also played a fun game using color filters to
        review what we learned and reveal secret messages.  The slideshow, along with some other
        learning links, can be found in the Topics section on the Resources page.</summary>

        <summary>One of our members taught us about 5 of their favorite nut-producing trees. 
        We also reviewed what we learned this year by making
        a fun, end of the year dessert. Each layer represents one of the projects we did during
        the year, and we asked questions to review what we had done and learned.</summary>
        <community-service>We made origami pointsettias and snowflakes, and donated them to

        <summary>We learned about what pH is, what affects the pH of soil,
        why the pH of soil matters, and how we can find soil pH. We did
        a short experiment to find whether our soil is acidic or basic
        and learned about other natural pH indicators such as turmeric,
        blueberries, and red cabbage. We also learned about how to choose
        a soil pH test kit and where to obtain them. To see the slideshow
        and video used in the meeting, go to Soil pH in the Resources page.</summary>

        <month>February</month>
        <day>19,</day>
        <year>2021</year>
        <warmup>Since this meeting was a combined meeting of both the Botany
        Besties and the Finger Lakes Conservation Club, we did a fun warmup
        to get to know each other.  We discussed what our
        favorite colors were, and what each of them meant to us (for example,
        red meant passion and purple meant unity).</warmup>
        <activity>We had a guest speaker who talked about “Environmental Stewardship
        Influencers in our Community”. We ‘broke’ into groups in separate breakout
        rooms, to discuss our ideal world.  After putting all our thoughts together,
        there was a clear ‘connection’ between the ideas from one person to the next.
        We want to be satisfied and happy with what we have, as well as find new things
        in our ideal worlds.  We want to increase the biodiversity and protect our
        environment while still finding a balance between ecosystems and people, and
        finding a connection between modern architecture and the natural world.  We
        could have a world rampant with nature and maybe dystopia, with plenty of space
        to live in and plenty of plants and animals with their natural environments. 
        We want to have an opportunity to express our creativity, through music, the
        arts, architecture, and building outdoor structures with natural materials. 
        This creativity could also fuel international collaboration and cooperation
        to share ideas, as well as art and music.  This would allow us to develop new
        technologies, cures, and preventions more efficiently with the goal to benefit
        everyone rather than an individual or small group.  From our discoveries, we
        could find ways to eliminate oppression, pollution, and carbon emissions, as
        well find enough food for everyone and find ways to work and live together as
        a community.  We would decrease consumption, not through barriers, but through
        the desire to consume less.  We could educate others with books, and live in
        harmony with animals and nature.  By sharing our visions of the ideal world,
        we can help these visions become a reality.  We can change our world through
        music, creating more natural spaces, innovative ideas, and working as a community. 
        From this presentation, we learned that we can change the world we live in, and that
        we are the future and we can make a difference in our world.  Our guest speaker
        encourages all of us to actively participate in town, village, and county meetings
        involving city planning.  This is how we can share our ideas and together can make
        our world a more livable and beautiful place for everyone.</activity>
        <summary>One of our members presented to us about how to care for three
        tropical plants. They also taught us how to decide what is a tropical plant.
        There were 2 main criterion:  Tropicals live in hotter places like near the
        equator, and tropicals usually need full sun. They also taught us about one
        of the tropicals they were growing that prefered only part sun. We also
        learned about perennial germination with Chrys Gardener, including scarification, vernalization,
        and how to grow and germinate the perennials in milk jugs outdoors. Both
        slideshows will be coming soon on the Resources page.</summary>

        <warmup>For the warmup this meeting, we asked the question,
        "If you had a million dollars and you had to spend it, what
        would you spend it on?"  We wrote down our ideas on a Google
        Jamboard.  We came up with weeding robots, libraries, a tree
        you can swing from, helping countries develop, and starting
        a guava farm in Taiwan.  Others wanted to spend the money on
        giving their choir new music, investing in gamestop,
        developing a landscape beautification program for downtown
        residents, and going on vacation.  We wanted to help endangered
        animals keep their habitats, build a treehouse, and spend the
        money on chickens and animals.  Keep up the wonderful ideas,
        Botany Besties!</warmup>
        <summary>With Alex Jackman, we propagated figs using a branch cutting. 
        Plants can be propagated by taking cuttings from a parent plant during
        dormancy in early spring, as we did with the fig trees.  We scraped
        the bark off the bottom of the fig stick and wrapped a piece of
        Parafilm around the stick to hold the moisture in.  After it was left
        in the soil eight weeks, our figs had developed a multitude of roots
        and a few leaves.  An advantage to branch cuttings is that branch
        cuttings grow faster than seeds.  This is because it doesn’t have to
        grow the stick and there is plenty of energy stored in the branch to
        produce strong roots and leaves.  When the figs have formed large,
        vigorous roots in their pots, or the roots begin to grow out the top
        or bottom of the pot, make sure to transplant them into a pot a few
        inches larger in diameter than the previous  pot.  The soil used
        should be sharply draining.  The mix should include one part high
        quality peat based indoor potting soil mixed with one part sand and
        one part perlite or sterilized ground bark.  Using high quality potting
        mix is very important to reduce the possibility of the fig contracting
        a disease.</summary>
        <community-service>We updated on how our gardens are growing.  Mainly,
        we are starting starters indoors for planting outdoors once the weather
        gets warmer.  We also talked about an upcoming invasives removal project. 
        We did some citizen science for the Oklahoma State University Natural
        Products Discovery Group looking for fungi in the soil that can help
        scientists fight disease.  For more information, you can go to the
        Resources page and view the slideshow.</community-service>

        <summary>We learned about green roofs with Zac Rood.  We learned
        about what makes a green roof successful, the types of green roof,
        and looked at some examples of green roofs.  Go to tvm.la for more
        examples of green roofs.</summary>
        <community-service>We propagated vegetables by seed for donation
        to the Community Action Plan "Increasing Food Security Through
        the Use of Vertical and Raised Bed Gardens".  We planted Swiss
        Chard, Red Mountain Celtuce, Lunix Lettuce, Ragged Jack Kale,
        Curly Kale, and Arugula.  They will be donated to the gardens
        to help those in need around the first week of June.</community-service>

        <summary>We talked a bit about our plan to make a green roof at the
        4-H Acres.  Then, we worked on propagating some plants.  There were
        four different compartments, water, paper towel, moss, and soil.  Each
        of the three plants, Sedum, Kalanchoe, and Begonia, were put into each
        of the four experimental plots.  We will make observations and test
        how each of the plants do in each of the experimental plots.  For more
        information and to view the slideshow, visit the Resources page.  We
        also had a tour of the 4-H Youth Fair Book and talked about what
        projects we could enter into the Fair and how to do so.</summary>
        <community-service>We talked about how we will do the Food Donation
        Project this year with our crop manager and introduced the project
        to a new member of teh club.  We also talked about how the invasives
        removal went May 8 at the 4-H Acres.  Two siblings had a garlic mustard
        pulling competition on how many garlic mustards they could pull, but they
        stopped counting at 350 plants.  Keep it up, Botany Besties!</community-service>

        this meeting by playing heads and tails with animals.  We had
        some very unique animals come past!  One of our members thought
        of kangaroos and octopi!</warmup>
        <summary>Last meeting, we made plant propagation kits.  We reviewed
        the questions and predictions we made last meeting, and talked
        about our results.  It seems that roots form especially well
        with well water!  We plan on making this project into a
        propagation methods poster club project for the 4-H Fair. 
        We also talked about what sections we would include in the
        poster, the different sections of the scientific method, and
        what we could include for each section.  We also plan on
        making a green roof.  The green roof will have modular
        boxes (each made and cared for by one of our members)
        that will be set on top of a wooden frame.  It will also
        compare the heat produced by metal and shingled roofs
        compared to green roofs and educate on global warming.
        We had a super full meeting!  For more information on

        <warmup>We did flower pounding bookmarks for our warmup this
        meeting.  Gather flowers and leaves.  Make sure they're juicy,
        but not too juicy like the center of a black eyed susan.  Lay
        your flowers and leaves face down on a piece of cardstock paper. 
        Tape a paper towel over the top.  If you decided to pick a
        very juicy flower, squish the center once by pressing down
        hard with you thumb.  With a hammer, tap the flower lightly
        until the pigment starts to show through onto the paper.  You
        can always lift up the edge of your paper towel to peek.  Once
        you're done, remove the paper towel and lift off the flowers
        and leaves.  You'll have the imprints of the flowers and
        leaves you collected on your paper!</warmup>
        <summary>We learned about soil texture.  We thought about how
        different size particles would affect soil drainage, fertility,
        and compaction.  We also had fun experimenting with
        finding the basic composition of three different soils using
        the texture-by-feel method and following the flowchart.  We
        compared our results, got super muddy, and had lots
        of fun!  We also evaluated the textures of our own soils. 
        We had very different soils!  We took a look at how soil
        settles into layers when it's mixed with water.  You can
        see each layer:  Clay, silt, and sand.  Then, our club
        co-leader split us into two groups and gave us a tool to
        take soil core sections and we evaluated the texture-by-feel
        of the soil around our meeting place.  It was very compacted,
        some areas more than others, which made it difficult to get
        the soil core tool into the ground to take a sample.  We had
        lots of fun at our first in-person meeting of 2021!</summary>
        <community-service>We plan on making a Green Roof as a teaching
        and experimentation garden.  We will install in next spring, but
        we're holding onto a few of our members' gardens.  One of our
        members' thyme plants were overflowing out of the box!  The
        recipe for Green Roof success, apparently, is to leave the
        boxes outside and let nature take care of the rest.</community-service>

        <summary>In this hands-on workshop, we learned about how
        to plant trees so they'll survive.  First, we chose an
        appropriate site for the white pine seedlings we planned
        to plant.  The site must be well-draining and must be
        cleared of weeds and other invasives like the multiflora
        rose.  Also, make sure the trees around it are disease-free
        (at least of any disease that would affect the white pines). 
        Then, we need to dig a hole twice the width and twice the
        height of the white pine's pot.  Make slashes on the sides
        so the roots can grow more easily.  Make sure to put the soil
        from the hole on the downhill side of the hole.  Then, add
        a few big handfulls of compost and a handfull of perlite to
        the bottom of the hole.  Tip the white pine upside down,
        pinching its trunk gently between the middle of two fingers
        and cradling the top of the soil.  Once it has dropped out
        of the pot, pull the roots apart with your hands so it
        resembles a hat instead of a cylinder.  Fill in the hole,
        making sure not to cover the white pine's crown.  Then,
        add a ring of wood chips around it that's about 4 inches
        tall.  Baby trees should be fenced with about a 2 foot
        radius between the trunk and the circumference of the
        fence.  Make sure to stake your fence!  After you're done,
        wash your tools off and let them dry so they stay shiny.
        In this picture, the larger of the two spades was my
        great-grandfather's and it has planted hundreds of trees.
        We're looking forward to seeing how your tree planting
        worked out, Botany Besties!</summary>
        <community-service>We plan to learn more about invasives
        and help out our friend (the guest speaker for this meeting)
        next year with her goal of planting 1,000 trees and removing
        invasives!</community-service>

        <summary>We learned about what hydroponics is with a Cornell
        professor, Neil Mattson.  We talked about what we need to supply
        for each of the plants, why we grow the crops we grow, how to make
        a small home hydroponics setup, and the different types of commercial
        hydroponics systems.  These types of systems include the raft or
        pond system, which is a large scale outdoor hydroponics setup with
        water about 1 foot deep.  The greenhouse system uses a rock wool
        growing medium, spaghetti pipes for watering, and supplemental
        lighting.  Any crops can be grown using this type of hydroponics
        setup, especially tomatoes and cucumbers.  In a greenhouse,
        it's easy to control pests naturally using packets of small
        insects that kill the pests.  These bugs are specifically
        chosen to stay in control.  Cucumbers can be grown in the
        greenhouse system as well, but they are grown in dutch buckets
        filled with pearlite.  Cucumbers can be rotated to grow strawberries
        in the winter and the cucumbers in the summer, but you have to
        make sure to clean the system thoroughly and disinfect it. 
        Finally, there's the nutrient film technique.  The plants are
        grown through holes in horizontal "gutters".  This is a
        particularly controlled type of hydroponics because there are
        sensors that make sure pH and nutrient levels are always at
        optimum.  They are also all automated, so there is no human
        labor needed.  Supplemental lighting is very important for
        each of these types of systems.  Since the amount of sun
        varies throughout the year, lights can be added to make
        make sure the light remains about constant, which can
        prevent plants from prematurely bolting.  However, it's
        not just about the lights.  Different wavelengths of light
        like red and blue also need to be kept constant.  But what
        about green?  Green isn't very energy effecient, so most
        commercial greenhouses don't use it.  Even without it, the
        nutritional values of crops in the hydroponics setups as
        opposed to grown outdoors are quite comparable.  To see
        more detailed notes, see the Google Document and slideshow
        on the Resources page.</summary>

        <warmup>For our warmup this meeting, we talked about what we
        would like to do for activities next year.</warmup>
        <summary>We learned about a few general characteristics of all
        conifers and then learned about four specific ones:  The Balsam
        Fir, European Larch, Norway Spruce, and Cedar-of-Lebanon.  Then,
        we had an identification activity.  We learned about the different
        parts of a conifer we can use for identification:  Bark, needles,
        cones, habitus, and location.  Then, we learned about identifying
        characteristics of sprigs of white pines, Austrian pines, cedar, Norway
        spruce, fir, hemlock, yew, and juniper.  Then, we applied what
        we learned in identifying a mystery conifer, which was a blue
        spruce sprig.  We found that Austrian pine cones are stout and have
        thick scales, hemlock cones are small with thin scales, and spruce
        cones are medium-sized with big scales.  Then, we learned a bit
        about dichotomous keys and tried one out on the Arbor Day website. 
        To review what we learned, we played a bingo game where we were
        given words and had to describe their characteristics.  This was a
        great meeting, Botany Besties! </summary>

        <warmup>We talked about our favorite plants and what we like to
        do related to gardening.  Some of like orchids or hydrangeas, and
        others like running around barefoot in the garden and digging
        potatoes!</warmup>
        <summary>We learned about indoor winter container gardening and what
        we can do during the winter to help our plants be productive.  We can
        use artificial light, heaters, water them, and use fertilizer, but these
        options all use quite a bit of resources.  So, how can we be more
        resource-efficient?  We can supplement our plants with sunlight, use
        plants with low light requirements, or use more energy-efficient LED
        lights.  For temperature, we can utilize the heat zones in our house
        and put heat-requiring plants near vents or cool-requiring plants
        on window sills.  We can give our plants non-chlorinated water so
        they can uptake more water.  And, we can supplement them with natural
        nutrition like goat manure or compost.  Then, we planted alfalfa sprouts
        in a jar, carrots in a juice container, arugula in a yogurt container,
        and garlic in a milk jug.  We hope everyone's seeds are growing well
        and we'll discuss how they're doing next meeting!</summary>

        can be used, and how to evaluate and guide a forest into health.  To
        learn more, check out the Resources page for The Terrific Trail Tour
        at Two.  We also collected interesting leaves around the 4-H Acres and
        classified them according to their leaf type, leaf shape, apex shape,
        and base shape.  We plan to continue collecting interesting leaves and
        taking pictures of them to create a booklet to display as a club
        project at the 4-H Fair next year.</summary>

        <summary>We learned about farming the woods with Ken Mudge and Chad
        Cully.  Due to the deluge, we were unable to take our planned tour at
        the MacDaniels Nut Grove.  We learned about how to grow mushrooms in
        a log, and even got to take some home with us!  We also learned how
        to identify some trees, the uses of ginseng, and grafting techniques
        for different purposes.  Mr. Mudge taught us how to propagate an
        Elder Flower (Sambucus canadensis).</summary>
        <mushroom-cultivation>
            <m>Drill a hole into the log the same size as the sawdust spawn
            inoculator.  Make sure your log is an oak log, for best results.</m>
            <m>Jab the sawdust spawn inoculator into the sawdust and inject
            the plug into the hole in the log.  The spawn contains mushroom
            spores, the tiny seeds of a fungus like a mushroom, mixed with
            moistened sawdust.</m>
            <m>Using a wool dauber or paintbrush, dab the wax over inoculation
            hole to seal it.  This will prevent the mushroom spores from drying
            out before they have a chance to bloom (grow a mushroom).</m>
        </mushroom-cultivation>
        <mushroom-harvesting>Mushrooms should be harvested when their cap edge
        has begun to split a little and the gills (the ridges on the underside
        of the mushroom cap) have developed fully.</mushroom-harvesting>
        <ginseng>Ginseng, or Panax quinquefolius, grows in theEastern United
        Steates, west to Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  It prefers deciduous
        forests and does not like clay or sandy soils.  It is usually started
        from seeds stratified for 18-22 months, and is marketable at three years.
        It requires 70% to 90% natural or artificial shade and a cold period
        during the growing season to go dormant.  Ginseng does not compete
        well with other plants, so weed control is imperative.  Ginseng can
        be used in toothpaste, soft drinks, tea, candy, chewing gum, extract,
        and herbal supplements.</ginseng>
        <paw-paw>Paw paw, or Asimina triloba, grows in the Eastern United States.
        It is considered rare and endangered in New York.  Paw paw is an understory
        tree that can tolerate some shade.  It isn't seen  in older growth forest
        as they will be shaded out.  Paw paw creates dense shade and inhibits
        sapling regeneration, and its leaves can grow to a foot long.  Pawpaw is
        tolerant of shade, and as a result can create a sub-canopy under the
        hardwood canopy, forming dense colonies.  It takes 7-8 years from seedling
        to fruiting.</paw-paw>
        <nuts>Hickory nuts and black walnuts are among some of the nuts that can
        be grown in agroforestry.  We experimented with cracking them open and
        eating the inside.  We also discussed how squirrels and nut production
        affect each other.</nuts>
        <grafting>Grafting can be used to stick compatible trees together, such
        as with saddle and cleft grafts; but can also be used to repair damaged
        branches, in bridge grafting (making a bridge over a damaged part of the
        tree's trunk), splice grafting, and arch grafting (helping make a part
        of the tree more robust).</grafting>

        <summary>To review what we've learned through the year, we had a fun
        activity with electricity.  We learned about circuits and created a
        matching game, then learned how to make our own batteries.  We connected
        chunks of potato, banana, and lemon together with zinc screws, copper
        wires, and alligator clips.  The transfer of electrons, small, negatively
        charged particals, from the negative zinc to the positive copper generates
        electricity.  We measured how much electricity was being produced with
        a voltometer, and tried using our potato batteries to power an LED
        light bulb.  We had lots of fun with our potato batteries and matching
        games!  For more information on what we did, check out the "Resources"

        along the way, including learning about how to tell if yeast is respiring
        with methylene blue and a microscope, and set up an experiment with
        carrot seeds and different water treatments.  We aim to find out which
        carrot seeds germinated the fastest, and most completely.  Check out the
        video, also on the resources page, to learn how to set up the experiment!
