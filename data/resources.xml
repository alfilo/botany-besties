        <details>Evolutionary Mimicry is a term for when one species evolves
        to mimic another.  The Bee Orchid evolved to mimic a female Orchid Bee.
        It not only looks like a female Orchid Bee, it also releases pheromones,
        a sort of smelly substance, to attract the male Orchid Bees.</details>
        <question>How does this help the Bee Orchid?</question>
        <answer>For the Bee Orchid, it increases the survival rate because it
        is able to spread more of its pollen.</answer>

        <summary>For our warmup this month, we unscrambled veggies with our bodies.
        We were suprised at everyone's creativity!  One person used sign language,
        another kid held up a pillow to make an I, and two stood hanging a kid
        between them to make an H...  We had a lot of fun!</summary>

        <summary>For the warmup this meeting, each member finds two objects.  Some of
        these objects included squash, bracelets, a small bottle, and a matrioshki doll
        (Russian nesting doll).  Then, each member takes turns telling
        a few sentences of a story, including both of their objects.  The next
        person then adds to the story with a few more sentences including
        their objects and repeat until everyone has had a turn.  We then read the completed
        story out loud.  We created a story about a bracelet with a secret on how to make a
        potion that made the meany zucchini nice again.  Everyone was very creative!</summary>
