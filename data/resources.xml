        to mimic another.  The Bee Orchid evolved to mimic a female Orchid Bee.

        a sort of smelly substance, to attract the male Orchid Bees.</details>

        <name>Chromatography</name>
        <details>Chromatography is the process of seperating out molecules based
        on their polarities.</details>
        <question>Could this still be done in space?</question>
        <answer>Since the capillary action that drives the molecules is not
        gravity dependant, Chromatography done in space would look similar to
        Chromatography done on Earth.</answer>
