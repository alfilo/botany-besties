        <name>Mimicry and Look-a-likes</name>
        <details>Evolutionary Mimicry is a term for when one species evolves
        to mimic another.  The Bee Orchid evolved to mimic a female Orchid Bee.
        It not only looks like a female Orchid Bee, it also releases pheromones,
        a sort of smelly substance, to attract the male Orchid Bees.</details>
        <question>How does this help the Bee Orchid?</question>
        <answer>For the Bee Orchid, it increases the survival rate because it
        is able to spread more of its pollen.</answer>

        <name>Chromatography</name>
        <details>Chromatography is the process of seperating out molecules based
        on their polarities.</details>
        <question>Could this still be done in space?</question>
        <answer>Since the capillary action that drives the molecules is not
        gravity dependant, Chromatography done in space would look similar to
        Chromatography done on Earth.</answer>

        <kind>Warmup:</kind>
        <name>Sprouting Letters</name>
        <summary>For our warmup this month, we unscrambled veggies with our bodies.
        We were suprised at everyone's creativity!  One person used sign language,
        another kid held up a pillow to make an I, and two stood hanging a kid
        between them to make an H...  We had a lot of fun!</summary>

        <kind>Warmup:</kind>
        <name>Object Story</name>
        <summary>For the warmup this meeting, each member finds two objects.  Some of
        these objects included squash, bracelets, a small bottle, and a matrioshki doll
        (Russian nesting doll).  Then, each member takes turns telling
        a few sentences of a story, including both of their objects.  The next
        person then adds to the story with a few more sentences including
        their objects and repeat until everyone has had a turn.  We then read the completed
        story out loud.  We created a story about a bracelet with a secret on how to make a
        potion that made the meany zucchini nice again.  Everyone was very creative!</summary>

        <kind>Warmup:</kind>
        <name>Veggie Art</name>
        <summary>We picked veggies from our garden and made art with them.  One member did
        a person, another did a butterfly, and someone even did a Mr. Potatohead!  Afterwards, we
        gave some ideas on how to reuse our veggies after we finished our veggie art.  Two
        members put theirs on a pizza, some just ate them raw (that took care of most of
        the veggies!), and others gave them to their chickens.  Don't worry, we didn't cook
        Mr. Potatohead.  He's reusable veggie art!  Great job, Botany Besties!
        For more examples, see the warmup on the Resources page and take a look at the slideshow
        we used during the meeting.</summary>
