        <name>Arbor Garden</name>
        <location>Tompkins County 4-H Acres</location>
        <description>This perennial garden was designed, planted
        and maintained by a youth 4-H member of the Botany Besties
        4-H Club.  The purpose of the garden is to attract and
        support pollinators including bees, hummingbirds, and
        especially butterflies.
        Many of the plants in the garden are native to the area.
        The flowers planted in the garden will bloom from early
        May until the first frost in October allowing for a long
        and continuous season of blooms.
        The plants have been integrated to create a large, visible
        swath to attract the pollinators.  The larger the area of
        blooms, the more motivated the pollinators will be to come
        visit the garden.
        Look carefully and enjoy!
        There are host plants for caterpillars in the garden.  Say
        hi to the critters, but leave them in their home to grow
        healthy and strong.
        Submit pictures of the critters you discover in the garden:

        The Botany Besties 4-H Club would love to hear from you!
